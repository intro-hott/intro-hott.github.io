excerpt: >
    What does homotopy type theory mean? This video presents the next answer: HoTT is a language for describing spaces. Under this interpretation, the unit type 1 represents the space consisting of just a single point. This video informally introduces the idea of "contractibility", which we'll rigorously define later and use extensively throughout HoTT.
